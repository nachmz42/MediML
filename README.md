# MediML: Intelligent Diagnosis and Prediction in Medicine

## Description
This project serves as the final endeavor for LeWagon's batch-1275 flex-time Data Science bootcamp. Within this project, we aim to harness the power of machine learning and neural networks to make intelligent predictions concerning cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and pneumonia using patient data and medical images.

## Training Data
We utilize several datasets from Kaggle to train our models, each serving a unique purpose:
1. [Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset): This dataset contains data relevant to cardiovascular disease risk prediction, essential for our cardiac health predictions.
2. [Diabetes Healthcare Comprehensive Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deependraverma13/diabetes-healthcare-comprehensive-dataset): The comprehensive diabetes dataset enables us to develop models for diabetes prediction.
3. [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset): Stroke prediction is a crucial aspect of our project, and this dataset provides the necessary data.
4. [Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction): We use this dataset to create models for predicting heart failure.
5. [Chest X-ray Pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia): This dataset contains chest X-ray images essential for pneumonia prediction.
